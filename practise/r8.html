<!-- Adding Hero- Section to Netflix Landing Page - 1
We will be building a Netflix Landing Page over the next few assignments:
This is how our project will look like when it will be completed:
Part 1

You have to create the first section of our landing page which we will call the hero-section


Create a div with the classname hero-section

Inside the div create a h1 element with text Welcome to Netflix

Inside the div create a p tag with text Join the millions of viewers already enjoying our streaming service.

Create a button inside the div with the text Get Started



Do not break lines inside any of the tags. -->
