<!-- 
    In this project, we will be displaying 5 numbers with a twist.

On initial load, show numbers from 1 to 5 in individual divs with id="number-display" and two buttons.
The first button will have id="back-button" and text "Prev Page", which will be disabled by default
(or whenever we are on the first page, i.e. showing numbers from 1 to 5)
the second button will have id="next-button" and the text "Next Page"

On clicking the Next Page button, we will display the following 5 numbers, i.e. from 6 to 10.
And since we are on page 2, the Prev Page button will be enabled, and upon clicking that, it takes
you back to the original 1-5 numbers and also disables the back button since we can't go back from page 1.
