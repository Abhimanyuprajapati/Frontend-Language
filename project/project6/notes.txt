## Project Objective

- You will be building a stock market dashboard using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- In the end, weâ€™ll have a web application that takes the input from stock symbol and fetch their data to show stock price related to the company.


## Project Context

- The stock market is a very tedious task to understand, and more difficult is to operate its application and track your stock.
- We will create a dashboard where you can add stocks based on their symbols and on the type of data you want.

- We will use the [**alphavantage.co**](http://alphavantage.co) API for this.


## Project Steps

- Create API key
    
    create an account at [https://www.alphavantage.co](https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY&symbol=IBM&interval=5min&apikey=demo) and get the API key that you would use in the project 
    
- Creating Input Field
    
    The website has an **input field** of type text which takes the symbol 
    
    The user then selects the time options among giving four options which are INTRADAY , WEEKLY , DAILY , MONTHLY
    
- Watchlist
    
    When the user click enter after selecting the time frame and symbol the stock is added with that particular timeframe to the Watchlist
    
- Modal
    - when The card of any stock is clicked then it adds a modal to the screen which shows the data related to that particular timeframe
- Delete card
